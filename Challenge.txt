I was talking to a friend of mine about coffee, I really like Java coffee, he's more of an arabica guy.
He also refers to coffee beans as coffee SEEDS. Weird.

Anyway...

Your task is to give me the next five numbers in this randomly generated sequence: 

536, 927, 658, 121, 148, 801, 889, 714, 218, 182

flag format: DREAM24{num1_num2_num3_num4_num5}

if the next five numbers were as follows: 123, 332, 39, 679, 90

the flag would then be DREAM24{123_332_39_679_90}

See you after my coffee break!
